[**Thesis: Design of an optimization algorithm for in-orbit inspection relative trajectories**](/MSc-Thesis-Presentation.pdf)

This thesis, developed at the Mission Analysis & Operations unit of Thales Alenia Space in Turin, presents a direct numerical optimization method to determine optimal trajectories for In-Orbit Servicing (IOS) missions, focusing on inspection and docking operations between a Servicer and a Target spacecraft. Based on Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) methods, a robust framework has been developed to generate trajectories that minimize the total mission âˆ†V and maximize fuel efficiency, while satisfying mission constraints. The optimization tool incorporates aerodynamic drag control and safety measures like control boxes and safety ellipses. Various Target shapes, including cubesats, ellipsoids, and a 3D model of the asteroid Didymos, are tested to ensure robustness. Genetic algorithms are used to refine solutions, enhancing the likelihood of finding global optima.
