# MSc Thesis - Pilot Ejection Dynamics
[**Thesis: Design of an optimization algorithm for in-orbit inspection relative trajectories**](/MSc-Thesis-Presentation.pdf)

The final proof concerns the simulation of pilot ejection dynamics in the MATLAB environment. The mathematical analysis of the ejection dynamics makes it possible to define the equations of motion and their initial conditions, from which the mathematical model of the system formed by the pilot and seat is derived, which is then implemented using MATLAB software. The implementation makes it possible to examine the temporal evolution of the states of the dynamic system and to graphically visualise the trajectory followed. The ultimate goal is to determine the combinations of flight parameters for which a safe ejection occurs, i.e. when the pilot and seat pass the vertical tail of the fighter with a certain safety margin.
